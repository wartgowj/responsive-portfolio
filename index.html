          <p>I'm a small town boy that was born and raised in the Northwoods of Wisconsin. I grew up in a town called Butternut. It had less than 400 people and my entire high school had about 100 students. Shortly after high school I started attending the University of Wisconsin. I recieved my major in Mechanical Engineering 5 years later. After a few short stints of trying to be an engineer, I decided a change of scenery was in order. I packed everything I could into my Toyota hatchback and headed west. 
          </p>
          <p>Fast forward to a few years later. I started working as a Production Manager for a Biotech supplier. It was supposed to be a short-term gig but it's going on 9 years now. Not sure how that happened. This is never what I wanted to do in life. I started to think about where I thought I would be at this age. What did 13 year old me forsee? He wanted to work with computers. He was proficient at using the DOS prompt back when computers had 1 MB of RAM and a monotone green screen. That's where I should be. Let's make it happen. So I did and here I am. 
          </p>
          <p>I'm commonly known as the Jack of all trades by my friends and family. I have so many hobbies that it's hard to know where to start when someone asks what I do for fun. I think it's the constant desire to learn new things that is always driving me to try something new. I guess my main hobby would be building/working on cars. They have always been my passion and my escape from reality. Nothing is better than getting into a car that I built from scratch and going for a ride alone. In fact, that's what I was doing when I made the decision to become a coder....
